This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on users' preferences and interactions. It uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide recommendations based on data such as ratings, genres, and more.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user-item interactions (ratings, reviews, etc.).
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies with similar attributes, such as genre, director, or actors.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized recommendations based on users' movie preferences.
- **Interactive UI**: A simple interface for users to interact with the recommendation system (optional).
- **Movie Dataset**: Uses publicly available movie datasets, such as MovieLens or IMDB, for training the model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the recommendation engine.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and numerical operations.
- **Flask/Django (optional)**: Web framework for creating a simple web app interface (if applicable).
- **TensorFlow/Keras (optional)**: For deep learning-based recommendation models (if applicable).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### For Running the Recommendation System:
1. If you are using a script-based implementation:
   ```bash
   python recommendation.py
   ```

2. If you are running a web application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts or visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to use the recommendation system (if web app is used).

### For Training/Testing the Model:
1. Modify `train.py` and run it to retrain the model using a new dataset or adjusted parameters:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. Evaluate the model's performance by running:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Datasets
The system uses the **MovieLens** dataset (or any other movie dataset) for training the recommendation engine. You can download the dataset from:
- [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
